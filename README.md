# Antheia (·ºàŒΩŒ∏ŒµŒØŒ±) Audio Service

A real-time audio transcription service that captures system audio and microphone input.

## Features

- Real-time system audio capture via loopback
- Microphone audio capture
- Speech transcription using Whisper (Faster-Whisper)
- Real-time audio visualization
- Modular architecture for separate audio processing

## Usage

```bash
python -m audio.streaming_main
```

You should see output like:

```
üéÆ device=cuda | üß† model=small | 16kHz | step=2s | trim=12s
üéö  external VAD: disabled
listening to SYSTEM audio only‚Ä¶ (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

Transcribed text will appear in real time as system audio is detected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Tune parameters in `audio/streaming_main.py`:

- `SAMPLE_RATE`: Audio sample rate (default: 16000)
- `CAPTURE_CHUNK_SEC`: Audio chunk size in seconds
- `PROCESS_INTERVAL_SEC`: How often to process audio (lower = lower latency)
- `TRIM_WINDOW_SEC`: Rolling context window for the ASR
- `LANG_PROBE_SEC`: Seconds of audio before first language detect
- `SIZE`: Model size ("tiny", "small", etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

```
audio/
	streaming_main.py         # Entry point, main logic, tunables
	system_stream.py          # SystemStream: streaming pipeline logic
	system_audio_capture.py   # System audio capture utilities
	streaming_transcriber.py  # OnlineASRProcessor: streaming ASR logic
```

## üß† How It Works (Technical)

- **SystemStream**: Orchestrates audio capture and transcription in separate threads.
- **OnlineASRProcessor**: Handles streaming ASR, context prompts, repeat-guard, and language switching.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Supplies the ASR model with up to 200 characters of prior context for better accuracy.
- **Repeat/Loop Guard**: Detects and suppresses repeated or stuck outputs.

## üèÜ Why Antheia ?

- **No microphone required**: Captures everything you hear, not just what you say.
- **Streaming-first**: Designed for live, low-latency use cases.
- **Extensible**: Easy to adapt for custom output, UI, or downstream processing.
